## 📖 Project Overview

**NovaForge** is a fully decentralized application (dApp)  It empowers users to generate, mint, and trade unique digital assets without writing a single line of code.

NovaForge stores products securely stored on **IPFS** and minted directly to the **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet** via custom smart contracts. The platform features a built-in marketplace supporting both **Fixed Price Listings** and **Timed Auctions**, operating entirely without a centralized backend database.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **100% On-Chain**: No database. No backend. The blockchain is the source of truth.
*   **Decentralized Storage**: All assets and metadata are pinned to IPFS via Pinata.
*   **Marketplace & Auctions**: Buy, list, and bid on assets using ETH in a secure, non-custodial environment.
*   **Protocol Factory**: Deploy your own ERC-721 NFT collections directly from the UI.
*   **Live Activity Feed**: Track mints, sales, and bids in real-time.
